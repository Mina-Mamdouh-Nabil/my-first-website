# My First Website

Welcome! This is **my-first-website**, my very first web project created as part of my personal learning journey. I’m Mina Mamdouh — a DevOps engineer in training, exploring front-end development and Git.

---

##  Project Overview

This is my **First DEPI repository**, where I built a simple but complete website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes:

-  `index.html`: The main landing page (and likely starting point for your site).
-  `contact.html`: A contact page for sending messages or inquiries.
-  `style.css`: Stylesheet to make the pages visually appealing.
-  `script.js`: JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior.
-  `README.md` (this): Documentation and guidance about the project.

---

##  Features

- Clean, basic structure: HTML for content, CSS for styling, JS for functionality.
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly — ideal for hands-on learning.
- Separate pages for home and contact, demonstrating site navigation.
- Great foundation for enhancements like responsive design, forms, or frameworks.

##  Motivation & Learning Goals

As a DevOps engineer, I’m delving into front-end development to:

-> Build a stronger overall grasp of web fundamentals.

-> Experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a real project.

-> Learn Git basics, like version control and project organization.

-> Prepare a foundation to gradually introduce responsive design, frameworks, or backend integration.

---

##  Future Enhancements

Looking ahead, I’d love to add:

-> Navigation menu across all pages for improved usability.

-> Responsive design—ensure it looks good on mobile and desktop.

-> Form validation on the contact page—client-side checks and interactive feedback.

-> Deployment—push it live via GitHub Pages or another host.

-> Advanced features like JavaScript interactivity, animations, or connecting with APIs.
